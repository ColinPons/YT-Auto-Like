Auto like script for Violent Monkey extension

Due to watching/listening to long playlists by smaller channels while I am working, at times I am not always able to like a video from a Youtuber who deserves it.
This script hits the like button when 60 seconds remain, this was added encase the video was skipped before getting to the end.

Works with Violentmonkey v2.32.0 and Brave 1.86.146 (Official Build) (64-bit).
